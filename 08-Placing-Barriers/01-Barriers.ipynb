    "A **barrier** obstructs the motion of particles in a simulation. In typical cases, barriers split space into two regions - one where particles are allowed and one where particles are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation's **periodic box** is _always_ periodic. When a **particle's** position leaves the primary image, it is _always_ wrapped back into the box on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must ensure that any barriers you place are commensurate with these **periodic boundary conditions**. Otherwise, particles may cross from an allowed to a disallowed region via wrapping:\n",
