    "To install HOOMD-blue on a desktop or laptop, first download and install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) following [the instructions in the conda documentation](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html). Then add the glotzer channel and install HOOMD-blue:\n",
    "```\n",
    "▶ conda config --add channels glotzer\n",
    "▶ conda install hoomd\n",

    "# Launching these examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to execute these examples interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using singularity containers\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need a copy of the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "▶ git clone https://bitbucket.org/glotzer/hoomd-examples.git\n",
    "▶ cd hoomd-examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The image contains all software needed to execute these notebooks. Use singularity to launch the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "▶ singularity exec -B $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR software.simg jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add ``--nv`` after exec to utilize GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* ``singularity exec`` - Ask singularity to execute a command in a container.\n",
    "* ``-B $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` - Bind mount your user specific temp dir. Jupyter uses this directory and singularity does not mount it by default.\n",
    "* ``software.simg`` - The image to launch.\n",
    "* ``jupyter notebook`` Execute jupyter notebook inside the image\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Jupyter starts, point your browser to the URL jupyter prints on the terminal. Jupyter inside the container accesses the configuration in your home directory on the host system. If you have a password configured for jupyter on your host system, use that to login. Otherwise, the URL should include a token that will log you in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using docker containers\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``glotzerlab/software`` image contains all software needed to execute these notebooks, and a copy of the notebooks themselves in ``/hoomd-examples``. Run this command to start jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "▶ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9999:9999 glotzerlab/software jupyter notebook --port 9999 --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser /hoomd-examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed the docker NVIDIA runtime, add ``--runtime=nvidia`` after ``run`` to utilize your GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* ``docker run`` - Ask docker to run a command in a container.\n",
    "* ``--rm`` - Delete the container when finished.\n",
    "* ``-p 127.0.0.1:9999:9999`` - Make port 9999 in the container available at localhost:9999. Don't leave of the ``127.0.0.1`` prefix - *doing so will expose port 9999 to the Internet*.\n",
    "* ``glotzerlab/software`` - name of the image to execute.\n",
    "* ``jupyter notebook`` - execute the jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* ``--port 9999 --ip 0.0.0.0`` - Jupyter should listen on port 9999 for connections from outside the container.\n",
    "* ``--no-browser`` - Tell Jupyter not to attempt to launch a browser.\n",
    "* ``/hoomd-examples`` - Location of the example notebooks in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Jupyter starts, point your browser to ``localhost:9999``. Copy the token from the jupyter terminal output and past it into the password box to access the notebook.\n",
