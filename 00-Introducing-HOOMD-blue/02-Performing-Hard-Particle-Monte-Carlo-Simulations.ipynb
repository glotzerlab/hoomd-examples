    "A hard particle Monte Carlo (HPMC) simulation represents particles as extended objects which are not allowed to overlap. \n",
    "There are no attractive or repulsive forces in the system.\n",
    "The **shape** of the particle alone controls how it interacts with other particles.\n",
    "Formally, the potential energy of the system is zero when there are no overlaps and infinite when there are.\n",
    "Purely hard interactions induce *effective attractions* between particles which can lead to ordered structures.\n",
    "For example, [hard regular octahedra will self-assemble into a bcc structure](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14038). \n",
