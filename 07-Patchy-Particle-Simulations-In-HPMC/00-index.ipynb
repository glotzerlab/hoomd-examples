    "# Patchy Particle Simulations in HPMC\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the `hpmc.pair.user` module, which enables the addition of user-defined, arbitrary, pairwise energetic interactions to a HPMC simulation.\n",
    "We first introduce patchy particles.\n",
    "Next, we briefly digress from patchy particles and introduce the `hpmc.pair.user.CPPPotential` class to show how to add (isotropic) pair potentials to a HPMC simulation.\n",
    "Finally, we implement the Kernâ€“Frenkel potential as a model for triblock Janus particles and simulate their self-assembly into a kagome lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the concepts introduced in the previous tutorials."
