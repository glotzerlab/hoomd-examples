    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are actions?\n",
    "- Why would I want to use custom actions?\n",
    "- What categories of actions exist for customization in HOOMD-blue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the concept of an action in HOOMD-blue.\n",
    "- Discuss potential use cases for custom Python actions.\n",
    "- Provide the categories of actions in HOOMD-blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are the objects that _act_ or operate on a\n",
    "`hoomd.Simulation` object. Looking at HOOMD-blue\n",
    "from the Python perspective, actions are wrapped\n",
    "or composed by operations. For example, objects like\n",
    "`hoomd.update.BoxResize` and `hoomd.hpmc.tune.MoveSize` contain\n",
    "actions internally. In other words, the actions implement the logic \n",
    "repsonsible for implementing the functionality of an operation\n",
    "(e.g. resizing the box for `hoomd.update.BoxResize`), while the\n",
    "operation handles some logistics like determining when the action\n",
    "will run using a `hoomd.Trigger` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions can be written in Python using `hoomd.custom.Action`.\n",
    "Through creating a subclass of `Action` HOOMD-blue's capabilities\n",
    "can be augmented and customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python Custom Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "HOOMD-blue offers Python `Action`s for a variety of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable more customization in Python.\n",
    "- Quicker prototyping of new simulation techniques.\n",
    "- Allow use of SciPy libraries for use cases like on-the-fly machine\n",
    "  learning forcefields.\n",
    "- Serve as a foreign function interface from a compiled library through\n",
    "  Python to HOOMD-blue's run loop. For instance, a Python library that\n",
    "  uses Rust as a backend could be used in a Python custom action.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Some example use cases are storing simulation data in a user's desired\n",
    "format whether that is a database, file format like HDF5, or other\n",
    "storage medium, simulating a system under a radiation source, or\n",
    "advanced sampling techniques.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Categories of Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, HOOMD-blue offers three types of actions: updaters,\n",
    "writers, and tuners. These categories serve to distinguish how an\n",
    "action interacts with a simulation and its `state` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Updaters** modify the simulation state when triggered.\n",
    "  `hoomd.update.BoxResize` is an example of an updater as\n",
    "  it changes the simulation box.\n",
    "* **Writers** observe the simulation state and write that data to a\n",
    "  file or some other object (writers should not modify the simulation  \n",
    "  state). `hoomd.write.GSD` is an example of a writer; it does not\n",
    "  change the simulation state, but writes it out to a GSD file.\n",
    "* **Tuners** modify another object's hyperparameters (or object\n",
    "  attributes). Tuners should not  modify state, but can modify another\n",
    "  object to improve performance. `hoomd.hpmc.tune.MoveSize` is an\n",
    "  example of this type of action. `MoveSize` tunes the integrator's\n",
    "  trial move sizes to reach a specific acceptance rate performance but\n",
    "  does not modify the simulation state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actions are objects that _act_ on a `hoomd.Simulation` object.\n",
    "- Actions can be written in Python using `hoomd.custom.Action`.\n",
    "- There are three categories of actions.\n",
    "    - Updaters: modify simulation state\n",
    "    - Writers: doesn't modify simulation state, writes out data\n",
    "    - Tuners: doesn't modify simulation state, modifies object\n",
    "      hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we start writing custom actions and using them\n",
    "in HOOMD-blue simulations."
