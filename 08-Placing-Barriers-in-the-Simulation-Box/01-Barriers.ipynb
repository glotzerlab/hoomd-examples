    "## Barriers and the simulation box\n",

    "A **barrier** obstructs the motion of particles in a simulation. In typical cases, barriers split space into two regions - one where particles are allowed and one where particles are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation's **periodic box** is _always_ periodic. When a **particle's** position leaves the primary image, it is _always_ wrapped back into the box on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must ensure that any barriers you place are commensurate with these **periodic boundary conditions**. Otherwise, particles may cross from an allowed to a disallowed region via wrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example of an invalid barrier](invalid-barrier.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example:\n",
    "1) A particle moving up from an allowed region wraps into a disallowed region on the bottom.\n",
    "2) A particle moving left from from an allowed region wraps into a disallowed region on the right."

    "Similarly, HOOMD-blue _always_ applies pairwise interactions accounting for the periodic boundary conditions. When desired, set the box length and width of the disallowed region accordingly to prevent such interactions:\n",

    "![Example of a valid barrier](valid-barrier.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the barriers are half the interaction distance away from the edge of the primary box image. Therefore, a particle who's center is exactly on the edge of the allowed region can never interact with a particle in the allowed region on the opposite side of the box."
