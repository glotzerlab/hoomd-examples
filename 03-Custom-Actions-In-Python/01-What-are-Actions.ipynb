    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are actions?\n",
    "- Why would I want to use custom actions?\n",
    "- What categories of actions exist for customization in HOOMD-blue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the concept of an action in HOOMD-blue.\n",
    "- Discuss potential use cases for custom Python actions.\n",
    "- Provide the categories of actions in HOOMD-blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are the objects that _act_ on a `hoomd.Simulation` object.\n",
    "Looking at HOOMD-blue from the Python perspective, actions are\n",
    "wrapped or composed by operations.\n",
    "For example, objects like\n",
    "`hoomd.update.BoxResize` and `hoomd.hpmc.tune.MoveSize` contain\n",
    "actions internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions can be written in Python using `hoomd.custom.Action`.\n",
    "Through creating a subclass of `Action` HOOMD-blue's capabilities\n",
    "can be augmented and customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python Custom Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "HOOMD-blue offers Python `Action`s for a variety of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not all HOOMD-blue users know C++, and this allows for customizing\n",
    "  HOOMD-blue's behavior in Python.\n",
    "- Python can be useful for quicker prototyping even if a final\n",
    "  HOOMD-blue integration would be in C++.\n",
    "- Python actions can use all Python libraries. This means SciPy,\n",
    "  scikit-learn, and other packages can be used directly. Likewise,\n",
    "  all the features of the Python standard library and syntax comes\n",
    "  for free.\n",
    "- Similar to the last point, if a high performance package has a Python\n",
    "  interface, then Python can serve as a foreign function interface\n",
    "  between HOOMD-blue's C++ core and the other packages. This prevents\n",
    "  needing to worry about compilation issues or other difficulties\n",
    "  that can come from managing compiled dependencies.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Categories of Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, HOOMD-blue offers three types of actions: updaters,\n",
    "writers, and tuners. These categories serve to distinguish how an\n",
    "action acts upon a simulation.\n",
    "* **Updaters** modify the simulation state\n",
    "when triggered. `hoomd.update.BoxResize` is an example of an updater as\n",
    "it changes the simulation box.\n",
    "* **Writers** observe the simulation state and \n",
    "write that data to a file or some other object (writers should not\n",
    "modify the simulation state). `hoomd.write.GSD` is an example of a\n",
    "writer; it does not change the simulation state, but writes it out to\n",
    "a GSD file.\n",
    "* **Tuners** modify another object's hyperparameters.\n",
    "Tuners should not modify state, but can modify another object to\n",
    "improve perfomrance. `hoomd.hpmc.tune.MoveSize` is an example\n",
    "of this type of action. `MoveSize` tunes the integrators move sizes for\n",
    "performance but does not modify the simulation state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actions are objects that _act_ on a `hoomd.Simulation` object.\n",
    "- Actions can be written in Python using `hoomd.custom.Action`.\n",
    "- There are three categories of actions.\n",
    "    - Updaters: modify simulation state\n",
    "    - Writers: doesn't modify simulation state, writes out data\n",
    "    - Tuners: doesn't modify simulation state, modifies object\n",
    "      hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we start writing custom actions and using them\n",
    "in HOOMD-blue simulations.section we start writing custom actions and using them in HOOMD-blue simulations."
